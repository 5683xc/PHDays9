# Fuzzing 101
So, this year (2019) me along with my colleague [Zubin](https://twitter.com/p1ngfl0yd) delivered a workshop in PHDays9 on fuzzing.

```
The prime focus of the workshop would be around the following areas: Fuzzing using SPIKE, blind and 
input-based fuzzing (AFL), finding memory bugs using ASAN with AFL integration, protocol fuzzing 
(HTTP, FTP, SMTP). Then we concluded the workshop by showcasing multiple bugs found during their 
research.
```

Here are the slides and OVA file which was used during the workshop.
